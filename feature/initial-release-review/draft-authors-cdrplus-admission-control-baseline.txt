1.  Scope

   This document specifies methods for the following:

   *  Dynamic Client Registration using trust asserted by the Ecosystem
      Authority

   *  Participant management through a centralised API

   *  Transport level security managed by the Ecosystem Authority

2.  Terms & Definitions

   CDR  Consumer Data Right

   Data Holder  A Data Holder is a party that holds consumer data for
      which sharing is to be conducted and for which their customer, the
      Consumer, participates in the authorisation process initiated by a
      Data Recipient.  Please refer to the expanded description of Data
      Holder within this document.

   Data Recipient  A Data Recipient is a party that receives consumer
      data from a Data Holder.  This occurs by way of a Software
      Product.

   Ecosystem Authority  The Ecosystem Authority represents the
      designated arbiter of trust between Data Holders, Data Recipients
      and the Consumer.  Within the Australian Consumer Data Right this
      is the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.

   Software Product  A Software Product represents the technology
      infrastructure, ostensibly a client registration with an
      authorisation server, operated by a Data Recipient for the
      purposes of receiving consumer data.

3.  Introduction

   This specification is currently a placeholder.  Please refer to the
   Register APIs and Security Profile sections of the [CDS] until this
   document evolves further.

3.1.  Data Recipient and Accreditation

   Ecosystems in alignment with this specification, notably the CDR,
   perform external validation of participant capabilities, particularly
   of Data Recipients.

   This occurs by way of a combination of Ecosystem Authority
   verification, external technology audit standards (notably ASAE3150)
   and legal assertions by Data Recipients carrying higher accreditation
   as to the suitability of new subordinate Data Recipients.

   As a result of this validation Data Recipients are granted an
   accreditation status which in turn influences the authorisation
   scopes that are made available to their relevant Software Products.
   Further detail on this process in the context of the CDR can be found
   within the CDR Rules and within guidelines published on the CDR
   website.

   The subject of accreditation is not intended to be covered by this
   specification, nor is the broader concept of a Data Recipient.  As a
   consequence this document focuses primarily on the relationship
   between Data Holder and Software Product with the Ecosystem Authority
   providing third party assurance with respect to technical admission
   control.

3.2.  Ecosystem Topology

4.  Ecosystem Authority

   The Ecosystem Authority is considered the primary arbiter of trust
   within the established ecosystem.  In order to provide multiple
   layers of trust the Ecosystem Authority operates a combination of:

   1.  A TLS Certificate Authority

   2.  A set of APIs representing the ecosystem (effectively a "phone
       book")

   3.  A JWT signing authority for the purposes of asserting permitted
       authorisation scopes of Software Products

   Within an Australian context the ecosystem is the Consumer Data Right
   and the Ecosystem Authority is the Register operated by the
   Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.

4.1.  Certificate Authority

   The Ecosystem Authority SHALL operate a Certificate Authority (CA),
   in accordance with ??TLS-Spec??.

   The Certificate Authority:

   1.  MUST issue certificates of at least 2048 bits

   2.  MUST issue certificates using the RSA encryption suite

   3.  MUST enforce the certificate profile as specified for each
       participant

   4.  MUST NOT issue certificates exceeding 365 days

   5.  SHOULD issue participant certificates via an Intermediate CA

   This is some yolo text

4.2.  Authentication

   For endpoints requiring authentication the Ecosystem Authority SHALL
   authenticate the confidential client using private_key_jwt specified
   in section 9 of [OIDC-Core].

   *  Establishment of trust between two parties, notably Data Holder
      and Data Recipient

   *  Centralised Certificate Authority to ensure transport level
      enforcement of ecosystem trust
